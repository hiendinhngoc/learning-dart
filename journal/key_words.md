Dart keywords are reserved words or terms in the Dart programming language that the compiler interprets differently.

    These keywords canâ€™t be used as the name of a variable, class, or function.

Dart keywords are case sensitive and must be defined properly.

This is the [offical document](https://dart.dev/language/keywords) about the Dart's key words.
